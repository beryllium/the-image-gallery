# The Image Gallery

**The Image Gallery** is the demo application for my upcoming book, 
[Building Web Applications with Silex 2](https://leanpub.com/silexwebapps).

Much of the content is in flux at the moment. The goal of each chapter is to
gradually grow the application into a fully functional image gallery with a
database and an automated testing suite (although the focus is not on Test
Driven Development).
 
The early chapters will grow the application organically, as often happens in
the real world. Then, some test infrastructure will be brought in so that the
resulting organic compost heap can be refactored into a well-structured and
easily-maintained application.
  
The purpose of this intentional foray into the wildlands of organic code is
twofold. One, it can be a helpful motivator for junior developers to see
actual, executable progress as they work toward a goal. Two, it teaches a
valuable lesson to those junior developers: even when a semi-working codebase
looks like a flaming turd-nugget, it's usually possible to salvage it into a
more rational structure.

It may come to pass that I change my mind on this concept. There's certainly a
risk of misleading developers or inadvertently helping them develop bad habits.

I haven't decided.
